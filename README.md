# super_mkt_sales_data_analysis

In this project, I tried to solve some business problems using advance excel and power BI.

In advance EXCEL, I carried out data transformation, and cleaning by quering all the data set obtained from the database.

I also also used some EXCEL functions to do calculations and creating columns.

I used POWER BI to creat some DAX functions by finding my REVENUE and INCOME.

I used POWER BI to perform my data modeling and visualization.
